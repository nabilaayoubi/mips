      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <h2>Our Project</h2>
      <p>MIPS project involves building a simulated MIPS processor using HTML5 and JavaScript. There is an input box, an output box, a table representing the 32-bit registers, and the MIPS datapath. Once the user enters his MIPS instructions inside the input box, he will get the type of each instruction as well as its binary representation inside the output box. The user will be able to observe how each of the instruction propagates from one stage into another through the MIPS datapath; he can see how the instruction is being fetched, decoded, executed, and then stored in memory or written back into the register file. The result of each of the instructions is going to be recorded inside the used the registers found the table. </p>
      <h2>Team</h2>
      <p>Getting accepted as USAID scholarship students  gave us the opportunity to know each other and start our journey into the computer science major at AUB.
         Our friendship encouraged us to work as a team on CMPS 253 project. As a team, we were very interested working on "MIPS SIMULATOR" website. This project gave us the opportunity to gain wide knowledge, and to benefit from each other's skills.
         Despite all the difficulties we faced during the project implementation, we were always cooperative and supporting each others. We enjoyed implementing every single detail in our project, and we are looking forward to work on further projects together. 
         We are glad to see you taking advantage from our MIPS SIMULATOR project. We hope that you will benefit from it.
