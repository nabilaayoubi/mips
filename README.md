# mips
MIPS project involves building a simulated MIPS processor using HTML5 and JavaScript. There is an input box, an output box, a table representing the 32-bit registers, and the MIPS datapath. Once the user enters his MIPS instructions inside the input box, he will get the type of each instruction as well as its binary representation inside the output box. The user will be able to observe how each of the instruction propagates from one stage into another through the MIPS datapath; he can see how the instruction is being fetched, decoded, executed, and then stored in memory or written back into the register files. The result of each of the instructions is going to be recorded inside the used the registers found the table.
